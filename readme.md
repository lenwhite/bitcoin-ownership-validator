# Key Signature Validator

  npm install
  npm run dev

This is a program that generates a nonce for a Bitcoin wallet address. It then takes in a signature and checks that:

1. The address is one that it has previously generated a nonce for
2. The message is the nonce that it had generated
3. The signature verifies that the message is signed by the private key corresponding to the Bitcoin address.
